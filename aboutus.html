            </header>
            <p>The Golden Spoon began as a small family bistro in Lyon, France, in 1985.  
        Built on a dream of bringing people together through food, it quickly became  
        a local favorite thanks to its warm atmosphere and timeless recipes passed  
        down through generations.</p>
